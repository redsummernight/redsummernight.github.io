<h2>00</h2>
<p>Couldn't sleep.</p>

<h2>01</h2>
<p>
	The traveler lay unmoving at the mouth of the forest for the third consecutive day,
	head three meters from their neck. The brain slugs worked fast.
</p>

<h2>02</h2>
<p>Lost the dictionary.</p>

<h2>03</h2>
<p>( ✿ᴗ_ᴗฺ).｡oO</p>

<h2>04</h2>
<p>Hated birds. Their persistent singing before sunrise didn't wake [self]. But hated them.</p>
<img src="{{ page.img.sept18.url }}" alt="{{ page.img.sept18.alt }}" title="{{ page.img.sept18.alt }}">

<h2>05</h2>
<p>Heard keys jingling. He would be up in the attic soon. He would not knock. Time to empty the chamber pots.</p>

<h2>06</h2>
<p>Brought limbs to the bath. Fed them to the cold, one by one.</p>
<img src="{{ page.img.sept27.url }}" alt="{{ page.img.sept27.alt }}" title="{{ page.img.sept27.alt }}">

<h2>07</h2>
<p>
	She sat silent and thin, melding into the old chair.
	She needed a sponge bath, then a change of clothes.
</p>

<h2>08</h2>
<aside>
	<ul>
		<li>Cave Carrot (1)</li>
		<li>Common Mushroom (1)</li>
		<li>Kale (1)</li>
		<li>Oil (1)</li>
	</ul>
</aside>
<p>Made breakfast.</p>
<p>
	He was to feed her. He tested the first spoonful. He spat on the floor.
	The floor was smoother than the walls and easier to clean.
</p>
<p>Forgot the sunflower oil.</p>

<h2>09</h2>
<p>Made breakfast.</p>
<p>Would rather not sit down. Laundry was fine. Low on detergent.</p>

<h2>10</h2>
<p>Put on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAzD2-1QhaU">music</a>.</p>
<img src="{{ page.img.sept25.url }}" alt="{{ page.img.sept25.alt }}" title="{{ page.img.sept25.alt }}" lang="ko">
<p>
	She murmured something and pointed at the window.
	<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/gallery/vagabond/">Opened it</a>.
</p>
<p>She seemed happy.</p>

<h2>11</h2>
<aside>
	<ul>
		<li>Coconut (1)</li>
		<li>Shrimp (1)</li>
		<li>Common Mushroom (1)</li>
	</ul>
</aside>
<p>Made lunch perfectly.</p>

<h2>12</h2>
<p>Checked the hydroponic tanks. Removed dead growth on six plants.</p>
<img src="{{ page.img.sept28.url }}" alt="{{ page.img.sept28.alt }}" title="{{ page.img.sept28.alt }}">

<h2>13</h2>
<p>Moved a shipment of hemlock into the storage room on the third floor.</p>
<p>Disturbed a hisser nest.</p>
<img src="{{ page.img.sept21.url }}" alt="{{ page.img.sept21.alt }}" title="{{ page.img.sept21.alt }}">

<h2>14</h2>
<p>Saved the shipment, two boxes of glassware, a liquid nitrogen dewar, and wrote off the rest.</p>
<p>He purged the nest. The room would be unusable and sealed for three weeks.</p>

<h2>15</h2>
<p>
	She fell in the sunroom. Tried to help her into the old chair, which was difficult with one good arm.
	She gave up for a second, and her body became heavy.
</p>
<p>She lied on the floor, stared at the ceiling and said nothing.</p>

<h2>16</h2>
<p>She was in bed. Back from the garden, he was at her side.</p>
<p>They shared quiet curses at their absent and insolent children.</p>

<h2>17</h2>
<aside>
	<ul>
		<li>Salmon (1)</li>
		<li>Amaranth (1)</li>
		<li>Kale (1)</li>
	</ul>
</aside>
<p>Made dinner.</p>

<h2>18</h2>
<p>Disinfected the old chair, but half its back was already burned away by vomit.</p>
<p>Made dinner for when she woke up.</p>
<p>Disinfected the busted lip.</p>

<h2>19</h2>
<p>Back in the attic. Lights out.</p>
<p>No moon, and the smuggled bottled bioluminescent leeches died. No reading this night.</p>
<img src="{{ page.img.sept16.url }}" alt="{{ page.img.sept16.alt }}" title="{{ page.img.sept16.alt }}">

<h2>20</h2>
<p>...</p>

<h2>21</h2>
<p>
	He pulled [self] out of the attic to help move her into the lab.
	Scrambled for clean sheets, spare clothes, hot water, and dehumidifiers.
</p>
<p>She had nearly suffocated on vomit, and her forearms were rapidly turning milky white.</p>

<h2>21.3</h2>
<p>Waited in the hallway. There was groaning and screaming behind closed doors, in three different languages.</p>

<h2>21.7</h2>
<p>The lab <em>exploded</em>.</p>

<h2>22</h2>
<p>The monster perched on the roof, tail and fire choking the top floors.</p>
<img src="{{ page.img.sept07.url }}" alt="{{ page.img.sept07.alt }}" title="{{ page.img.sept07.alt }}">
<p>Ran down the stairs. Lungs burned. Legs burned. So did everything else.</p>

<h2>23</h2>
<p>
	Ran. The tower burned far away in a lonely bonfire. The forest bit at the heels.
	The ground gave way to water. The cold stabbed everywhere.
