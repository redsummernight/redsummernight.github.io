	<p>My mind is a cold, barren wasteland.</p>
	<p>
		Ideas flee like
		<em>startled</em> creatures
		at the sound of my <span class="footsteps">footstep</span>s.
	</p>
	<p>
		I envy those who can pack their art with details.<br>
		I envy those who know how to use
		<strong class="colors">
			<span>more</span>
			<span>than</span>
			<span>three</span></strong>
		<span class="fake-link" title="feels like there should be a link here...">colors</span>.<br>
		I envy those with fertile imaginations.<br>
