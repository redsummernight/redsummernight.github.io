	<p>
		I struggle to fulfill the demands of my position in a landlocked state,
		but I scrape by on a room full of seashells and sand dollars.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is the only job I've known since my skin felt saltwater for the first time.

<section class="seagod">
	<p>
		I am a <strong>mermaid</strong> who fought my creator, a sea god.
	</p>
	<p>
		A lesser god, never in love with the sea, but his temper was as turbulent as her storms,
		crushing little boats between heavy hands.
	</p>
	<p>
		Yet there is a difference. The <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/ocean/">ocean</a> drowns all sailors just the same. My father only ever hit me.

<section class="outro">
	<p>
		The land would not have me, the god of the sea would kill me,
		and I am drowning underneath the weight of both.&rdquo;
