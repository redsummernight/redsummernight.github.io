# redsummernight

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/redsummernight/redsummernight.github.io.svg?branch=master)][travis]

[travis]: https://travis-ci.org/redsummernight/redsummernight.github.io

My [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.org) website:

- Stable: https://redsummernight.neocities.org/
- Latest: https://redsummernight.github.io/

## Setup

To view the site on your machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/redsummernight/redsummernight.github.io.git
cd redsummernight.github.io
gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve # http://localhost:4000
```

### Building for Neocities

Note:

- The custom 404 page is `not_found.html` at the site root, unlike `404.html` for GitHub Pages.
- Neocities has [restricted file types](https://neocities.org/site_files/allowed_types) for free accounts.
- SVG files should have the XML declaration (e.g. `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`), since
  certain MIME type detection tools (including the one used by Neocities)
  [will not recognize SVGs without it](https://github.com/svg/svgo/issues/836).
